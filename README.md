# Pick My Episode
Trouble picking an episode of The Office (US) to watch? Let us pick one for you.

This was built in a day by a procrastinating computing student using an API from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/), jQuery ajax and vanilla JS. The site's main purpose is to randomly suggest an episode of The Office (US) to you for when you can't choose, however there are plans to add support for more shows in future.

Simple install.
